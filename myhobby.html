        Different people have different hobbies based on their taste and preferences. Some like swimming, some dancing
        and some prefer to read a book in isolation. One thing I like to do is to walk in the woods in silence and calm.
        I could say that it is a hobby of mine.

        I like to walk as close to the nature as possible. It just feels so good that my heart always crave for a walk
        through the forest, park or any landscape that has been untouched from human interference. Walking fills my
        lungs with clean, fresh air and gives me a new lease of life.
